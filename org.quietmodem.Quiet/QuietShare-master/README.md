# QuietShare

A proof of concept Android app to send messages between phones using audio. 

Created to test the [Quiet for Android](https://github.com/quiet/org.quietmodem.Quiet) library

It's possible to demonstrate sending messages from one device to another. Reliability is currently suboptimal.

# Dependencies

By default, QuietShare expects the [Quiet for Android](https://github.com/quiet/org.quietmodem.Quiet) to be located in the folder `../org.quietmodem.Quiet/quiet` relative to itself. That is, QuietShare and [Quiet for Android](https://github.com/quiet/org.quietmodem.Quiet) should have the same parent folder.
